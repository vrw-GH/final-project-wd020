Hi, my name is Victor.
I come from Sri Lanka and live in Bavaria since 2020.

I was the General Manager for a Solar Technology company for over 20 years up until i moved to Germany.

I was always very interested in future7sci-fi and digital tech, and discovered the allure of programming - i like the logic, and the immediate output you get from coding. When I first began to use PC's and to "code" - even the internet wasnt yet born!

So, I decided to start anew since moving here, and so thats why i joined this bootcamp.


Now let me welcome you all to our presentation for the WBS Coding School final project for
FS Web and App Developer course.

So. My partner Abdu and I worked together to build this project which we are proud to present you today!
He had a wonderful idea - now over to Abdu, to tell you all about it...
